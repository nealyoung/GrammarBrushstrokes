For example, if you were writing about an angry cat, you might use words like hissing and spitting to create an image of the cat in action.')

For example, if you were writing about an angry cat, you might use absolutes such as claws extended and teeth bared, or eyes rolling and tail twitching, to paint a vivid picture for the reader. Can’t you just imagine that angry beast coming towards you?')
